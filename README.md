# Blotes - Blog with notes

This is a Vue project that was intent to solve my problem of whenever I want to write down what I learned or what difficult tasks solved. Sometimes the content is sufficient enough to make it a blog post, but sometimes, actually quite often it is just some piece of knowledge or short thoughts. Thus, I want these information, no matter short thoughts or a complete blog post, to be organised in a place, which is mainly this project offers, a simple blog place that allows me to edit with notes and blog posts.

At the adding page, just like what the header says, add the post with only title and edit with notes later in the edit page. After adding the new post, it will lead back to the homepage and by clicking on each post will lead to page below, the post content page.

### Blog post page

This page simply displays the post content. What next to the header are edit and delete button. If you click on the edit button, it will lead to the edit page.

### Blog edit page

This page is my intention of building this website. It allows me to edit the blog post and right next to the blog post I can add notes to help me with my post. Moreover, if I haven't had content that is sufficient for a post, some short thoughts can be organised here.
